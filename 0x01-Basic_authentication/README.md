# Basic Authentication Project

## Overview

This project focuses on understanding and implementing Basic Authentication on a simple API. While industry standards recommend using established modules or frameworks for authentication (such as Flask-HTTPAuth in Python-Flask), this project aims to teach the underlying mechanisms by implementing the process manually.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- The concept of authentication.
- What Base64 is and how it is used.
- How to encode a string in Base64.
- The principles of Basic Authentication.
- How to send the Authorization header in HTTP requests.

## Resources

To complete this project, you should review the following resources:

- REST API Authentication Mechanisms
- Base64 in Python
- HTTP header Authorization
- Flask documentation
- Base64 - concept

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- All scripts will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7.
- Each file must end with a new line.
- The first line of every file should be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Code should adhere to the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5).
- All files must be executable.
- The length of files will be checked using `wc`.

### Documentation

- All modules should include documentation that can be accessed using `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`.
- All classes should have documentation accessible via `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`.
- All functions, both inside and outside of classes, must have documentation accessible using `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`.

## Basic Authentication Implementation

### Steps

1. **Understanding Authentication**: Learn what authentication means in the context of web applications and APIs.
2. **Base64 Encoding**: Understand Base64 encoding, how to encode a string in Base64, and its usage in HTTP headers.
3. **Basic Authentication**: Grasp the concept of Basic Authentication and how it is implemented.
4. **Authorization Header**: Learn how to construct and send the Authorization header in HTTP requests.
