# User Authentication Service

## Overview

This project involves creating a user authentication service using Flask. While industry standards recommend using established modules or frameworks like Flask-User for authentication, this project aims to help you understand the underlying mechanisms by building a custom authentication system.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Declare API routes in a Flask application.
- Get and set cookies.
- Retrieve request form data.
- Return various HTTP status codes.
- Implement basic user authentication functionalities from scratch.

## Requirements

- **Editors**: You can use `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs` to edit your files.
- **Environment**: The project will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7.
- **File Endings**: Ensure all your files end with a new line.
- **Shebang**: The first line of all your files should be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- **Documentation**: Each module, class, and function should have proper documentation explaining its purpose and functionality.
- **Style**: Follow the `pycodestyle` (version 2.5) style guide for Python code.
- **Executable Files**: All your files must be executable.
- **Length**: The length of your files will be checked using the `wc` command.
- **Dependencies**: You will use `SQLAlchemy 1.3.x` for ORM and `bcrypt` for password hashing.
