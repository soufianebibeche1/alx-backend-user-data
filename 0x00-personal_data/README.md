# Personal Data Authentication Project

## Overview

This project focuses on handling Personally Identifiable Information (PII) securely, implementing user authentication, and logging activities in a back-end environment. The project covers the following key areas:

- Understanding and handling PII
- Creating a log filter to obfuscate PII fields
- Encrypting passwords and verifying their validity
- Authenticating to a database using environment variables

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Adherence to the `pycodestyle` style guide (version 2.5)
- All files must be executable and end with a new line
- Proper documentation for modules, classes, and functions
- Type annotations for all functions

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

1. Identify examples of PII.
2. Implement a log filter to obfuscate PII fields.
3. Encrypt passwords and verify input passwords.
4. Authenticate to a database using environment variables.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main entry point for the application.
- `auth.py`: Handles authentication and password encryption.
- `logging_filter.py`: Contains the log filter implementation.
- `config.py`: Manages environment variables for database authentication.
- `README.md`: Project documentation file.
